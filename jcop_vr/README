Title   :  JCOP Simulation Virtual Reader Driver
Author  :  Kenichi Kanai
Version :  0.1.0
License :  MIT License, see LICENSE
Requires:  Windows 2000

  This driver is a Windows version of JCOP Simulation ifdhandler (see JPCSC[1] 
  for more information). It enables your PC/SC client software on Windows 2000 
  to talk with the JCOP simulator executing JavaCard applet debug process. 

Files:
======
  1. jcop_vr.sys: kernel-mode driver.
  2. jcop_proxy.exe: user-mode application.

  As it seems to be difficult to invoke socket function (or TDI function) from 
  kernel-mode driver, the user-mode application invokes the Winsock function to 
  mediate interaction between the kernel-mode driver and the JCOP simulator. 

Notice:
=======

  * Only supports Windows 2000: This driver is developped as a legacy smart card
  driver and needs help of Smart Card Helper service which has been deprecated from
  WinXP SP2. 
  * Only supports T=0: This driver does not parse ATR and always says "select T=0
  Protocol". 

Installation & usage:
=====================
(or how to debug your JavaCard Applet)

  1. Install jcop_vr.sys. I usually use DIP.exe provided at [2]. 
  2. Execute Eclipse or JCOP Tools. 
  3. Set some break points in your JavaCard Applet and invoke JCOP debugger. 
  4. After successfully installed your applet, type "/close" in JCOP Shell window
  to close JCOP Shell session. Otherwise, you can not connect to JCOP simulation
  socket server. 
  5. Execute jcop_proxy.exe. 
  6. Open service in control panel, select "Smart Card" service (not "Smart Card
  Helper" service) and restart it. 
  7. Execute your own PC/SC application and invoke some commands. 
  8. You may need some reboot to make this drivper work properly. For example, if
  you have uninstalled this driver, you need to restart your pc before the next 
  installation.

Compilation:
============
 You need "Windows Server 2003 SP1 DDK" to build these modules. 

  jcop_vr.sys
    1. Invoke "Windows 2000 Checked Build Environment". After you have successfully
    installed DDK, you can find it "start->programs->Development Kits->Windows DDK
    3790.1830->Build Environments->Windows 2000->Windows 2000 Checked Build 
    Environment". 
    2. Change directory to (somewhere you download source)\jcop_vr\kernel. 
    3. Input "build". 
    4. You will find newly build jcop_vr.sys under (somewhere you download 
    source)\jcop_vr\kernel\objchk_w2k_x86\i386 directory. 

  jcop_proxy.exe
   It is almost same as building kernel-mode driver. 
    1. Invoke "Windows 2000 Checked Build Environment". 
    2. Change directory to (somewhere you download source)\jcop_vr\user. 
    3. Input "build". 
    4. You will find newly build jcop_proxy.exe under (somewhere you download 
    source)\jcop_vr\user\objchk_w2k_x86\i386 directory.
