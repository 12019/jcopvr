Title   :  JCOP Simulation Virtual Reader Driver
Author  :  Kenichi Kanai
Version :  0.3.0
License :  MIT License, see LICENSE
Requires:  Windows 2000

  This driver is a Windows version of the JCOP Simulation ifdhandler (see
  JPCSC [1] for more information). It enables your PC/SC client software
  on Windows 2000 to talk with the JCOP simulator executing JavaCard applet
  debug process. 

Files:
======
  1. jcop_vr.sys: kernel-mode driver.
  2. jcop_proxy.exe: user-mode application.

  As it seems to be difficult for me to invoke socket functions (or TDI 
  functions) from a kernel-mode driver, the user-mode application invokes
  Winsock functions to mediate interaction between the kernel-mode driver
  and the JCOP simulator.

Notice:
=======
  * Works only for Windows 2000: This driver is developed as a legacy 
  smart card driver and needs a help of Smart Card Helper service which 
  has been deprecated from Windows XP SP2. 
  * T=1 is not fully supported: As this driver is a virtual driver, it has
  minimal error free operations. No error detection and correction are 
  implemented.
  * No warranty: This software is provided on an "AS IS" basis and without
  any warranty. This software includes a kernel-mode driver and may induce
  a Blue Screen of Death (or damage your system), but you are solely 
  responsible for determining the appropriateness of using this software.

Installation & usage:
=====================
(or how to debug your JavaCard Applet)

  1. Install jcop_vr.sys. I usually use DIP.exe provided at [2]. 
  2. Execute Eclipse or JCOP Tools. 
  3. Set some break points in your JavaCard Applet and invoke JCOP debugger. 
  4. After successfully installed your applet, type "/close" in JCOP Shell
  window to close JCOP Shell session. Otherwise, you can not connect to 
  JCOP simulation socket server. 
  5. Execute jcop_proxy.exe. Type "jcop_proxy start" in command prompt.
  6. Open service in control panel, select "Smart Card" service (not "Smart
  Card Helper" service) and restart it. 
  7. Execute your own PC/SC application and invoke some commands. 
  8. To stop jcop_proxy.exe, type "jcop_proxy stop" in command prompt.

  * You may need some reboot to make this driver work properly. For 
  example, if you have uninstalled this driver, you need to restart your
  pc before the next installation. 
  
Compilation:
============

  jcop_vr.sys
    You need "Windows Server 2003 SP1 DDK" to build jcop_vr.sys. 

    1. Invoke "Windows 2000 Checked Build Environment". After you have 
    successfully installed DDK, you can find it "
    start->programs->Development Kits->Windows DDK 3790.1830->Build 
    Environments->Windows 2000->Windows 2000 Checked Build 
    Environment". 
    2. Change directory to (somewhere you download source)\jcop_vr\kernel. 
    3. Input "build". 
    4. You will a find newly built jcop_vr.sys under (somewhere you download
    source)\jcop_vr\kernel\objchk_w2k_x86\i386 directory. 

  jcop_proxy.exe
    It is a Visual Studio .NET 2002 solution. Open the solution with your
    Visual Studio and build it.
